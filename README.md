# davinci-resolve-studio for Arch Linux
Archlinux Package to install Blackmagic's Davinci Resolve Studio, based on https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/davinci-resolve/

This package adds the package name and sha256 from the studio version zip file, and also adds an udev rule for the dongle.

##TODO: 
I don't use BlackMagic's panels, so I didn't bother to add the BMDPanel support drivers & daemon. If someone could test it, I could add it to the package.
